# 💡 Proposed Solution

🚀 **HydroWatch** offers a Fully Automated Water Quality Monitoring and Control System with the following features:

1. **🌊 Water Quality Monitoring**:
   - Sensors assess water purity from borewell and municipal sources in real time.
   - Alerts are generated when impurities are detected.

2. **⚙️ Motor Automation**:
   - Automatically pumps water based on water purity and tank levels.
   - Sends notifications like "Motor is running, pure water is being pumped."

3. **💧 Water Source Detection**:
   - Notifies users when clean municipal water becomes available with alerts like "Narmada water is now available."

4. **🛠️ Manual Control & Alerts**:
   - Alerts users for manual intervention when water quality is poor.

5. **✅ Efficiency**:
   - Ensures only clean water is used.
   - Reduces manual effort in water management.

✨ HydroWatch simplifies water management, making it **safe, efficient, and automated**.
