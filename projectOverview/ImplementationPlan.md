# 📋 Implementation Plan

## 🛠️ Steps for Implementation:

1. **📍 Sensor Placement**:
   - Install turbidity sensors on borewell and municipal water pipes.
   - Place flow sensors on water inlets.
   - Install water level sensors in tanks.

2. **🔗 Hardware Setup**:
   - Connect sensors and motor to Arduino Uno.
   - Set up NodeMCU for cloud communication.

3. **💻 Programming**:
   - Write code for data acquisition and motor control.
   - Set thresholds for turbidity and water levels.

4. **⚙️ Testing and Calibration**:
   - Test with controlled water samples.
   - Adjust turbidity thresholds for accuracy.

5. **🚀 Deployment**:
   - Install and integrate the system.
   - Monitor performance and refine functionality.
