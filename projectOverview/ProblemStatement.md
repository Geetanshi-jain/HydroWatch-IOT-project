# 🛑 Problem Statement: Ensuring Safe and Efficient Water Management  

## **1. Contaminated Water**  
💧 Water contamination is a widespread issue affecting households, leading to serious health risks. Families often unknowingly use impure water for drinking and household purposes, which can cause diseases like diarrhea, cholera, and other waterborne illnesses.  

---

## **2. Infrequent Testing**  
🕒 Most households do not have a system for regular water quality checks. Water is typically tested only occasionally, making it difficult to detect contamination early. This delay can expose families to unsafe water for extended periods.  

---

## **3. High Costs of Testing**  
💰 Hiring professionals or using specialized equipment for regular water testing is expensive and impractical for most households. This cost barrier prevents many families from ensuring the quality of their water consistently.  

---

## **4. Water Wastage**  
🚱 Pumps often continue running even when the water quality is poor, leading to unnecessary water wastage. This inefficiency not only wastes a valuable resource but also increases electricity costs.  

---

## **5. Difficulty Identifying the Source of Contamination**  
❓ It is challenging to determine whether contamination originates from the borewell, municipal supply, or other sources. Without clear identification, addressing the root cause becomes nearly impossible.  

---

## **6. Unreliable Manual Checks**  
⚠️ Manual water quality checks are often forgotten or missed. Even when performed, they rely on human accuracy and consistency, which are prone to error. This unreliability makes it hard to ensure water safety at all times.  

---

## **7. Lack of Real-Time Monitoring**  
📉 Municipalities like Nagar Palika are tasked with providing clean water, but real-time monitoring at the consumer level is lacking. Families are unaware of the water’s quality as it flows into their homes.  

---

## **8. Fluctuating Borewell Water Quality**  
🌊 Borewell water quality often fluctuates due to environmental factors or infrastructure issues. There is no automated system to detect these changes or alert users in real time.  

---

## **9. Inefficient Water Flow Management**  
🔄 Managing water flow between tanks and controlling the motor manually adds unnecessary complexity to household water management. Families often struggle to ensure that only clean water is pumped or used, further complicating the process.
