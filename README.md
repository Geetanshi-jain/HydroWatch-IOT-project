# **HydroWatch: IoT-Based Water Quality Monitoring & Automation System**

---

## **Overview**

**HydroWatch** is an IoT-powered solution designed to address the pressing need for real-time water quality monitoring and automated household water management. This innovative system ensures access to clean water while simplifying motor and water flow control processes, making it an efficient and scalable solution for families and industries alike.

---

## **Project Goals**

HydroWatch aims to:  
- Monitor water quality from municipal and borewell sources.  
- Automate motor operation based on water levels and quality.  
- Notify users via SMS and audio alerts about water quality and system status.  
- Provide manual control options for cases of water impurity.  

---

## **Features**

1. **Water Quality Monitoring**  
   - Detects water impurities in real-time using turbidity sensors.

2. **Smart Motor Control**  
   - Automatically pumps water based on tank levels and purity.

3. **Real-Time Alerts**  
   - Sends SMS notifications to family members when water quality issues arise or when municipal water is available.

4. **Manual Valve Control**  
   - Alerts users to manually manage water flow when needed.

5. **Audio Notifications**  
   - Provides sound alerts for critical updates.

## **Getting Started**

Follow these steps to set up HydroWatch:  

### **1. Hardware Setup**  
   - Place turbidity and flow sensors in the designated water pipes.  
   - Connect sensors and water level indicators to an **Arduino Uno**.  
   - Set up the GSM module for SMS alerts.  

### **2. Software Setup**  
   - Install the **Arduino IDE**.  
   - Load the code from the **Code/** directory onto the Arduino.  
   - Configure sensor thresholds and GSM settings.  

### **3. Testing and Calibration**  
   - Test with different water samples to fine-tune sensor readings.  
   - Adjust the thresholds for turbidity levels in the code.  

### **4. Run the System**  
   - Start the system and verify sensor readings, motor control, and alert mechanisms.
